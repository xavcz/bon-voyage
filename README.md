![CI Build](https://travis-ci.org/xavcz/bon-voyage.svg?branch=master)

> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Bon Voyage ðŸ“½

Video app, mostly designed for my Vimeo account : https://vimeo.com/sakados

### Vimeo Token

This app relies on Vimeo API: you should [create a Vimeo App and get your own access token](https://developer.vimeo.com/apps/new).

Then add it to `.env` file ðŸ™ˆ

### Start

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn

# start the app
yarn start
```

### Dev

This app uses [Cosmos](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos) as a component explorer to dev components in isolation!

```sh
# start the app
yarn cosmos
```

### Test

\o/

```sh
# run the tests
yarn test
```
